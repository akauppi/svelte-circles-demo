# svelte-happy-demo

A playground for developing _interactive_ SVG graphics, as a Svelte component.

Aims:

- [ ] apply the Toolbook/Flash programming model to modern web apps
   - [ ]Â vector graphics with scripts and cascading events
- [ ] allow working with SVG assets in separate files (editable)
- [ ] ... (other aims still foggy)

[HTML 5 SVG page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp) (w3schools) mentions that SVG were "not suited for game applications". One of the purpose of this demo is to see, how far that holds true, in 2019-20.


## Requirements

- npm

## Getting started

```
$ npm install
```

*If you see errors, check out the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.*

```
$ npm run dev

  Your application is ready~! ðŸš€

## Tests

<font color=red>tbd. Tests are intended, using Mocha, Puppeteer or similar (what is this C... fellow?).</font>


## Developing

While you're running the `npm run dev`, changes to the code are reflected in the browser.

>You will need to hit 'refresh' in the browser, though. Remains open whether we want the browser to automatically refresh - it may also be a unwanted.


## Using

>This module is not currently published to the online `npm` repo. This is because it's a proof-of-concept and not really useful as from-the-shelf. If this changes, we may rethink polishing and publishing.

To use the component in your other (npm) project, use:

Here, just once:

```
$ npm link
```

In the using project:

```
$ cd <your-project>
$ npm link svelte-circles-demo	# the name in 'package.json'
```

This should provide you the component in the other project.

## Troubleshooting

### macOS Catalina

If you're on macOS 10.15 and get a bunch of errors about `node-gyp`, see [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/1927#issuecomment-549349352).

Essentially: 

>```
>$ sudo rm -rf $(xcode-select -print-path)
>$ xcode-select --install
>$ /usr/sbin/pkgutil --packages | grep CLTools   # should list some files
>```

Then try again `npm install`.
