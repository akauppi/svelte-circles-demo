# Todo

- [ ] Grouped graphics (incl. transformations when group is e.g. tilted)
- [ ] Graphics from external `.svg` files
- [ ] Tests with mocha
- [ ] <strike>publishing</strike>
- [ ] more seasoned undo/redo system
- [ ] make sure SVG groups work fine; also with rotation (mouse/touch coords)
- [ ] animations by class, e.g. ":wobble" (akin to Svelte)
- [ ] host a sample at a URL, link at GitHub title

<!-- consider
>For example, the fill property controls the paint used to fill the inside of a shape, and the width and height properties are used to control the size of a ‘rect’ element.

We could make `fill` style be applied, i.e. make SVG seem more uniform than 
it is.

Such a feature should be explicitly "opt-in", so that we don't confuse people about what SVG abstraction level really is.

## Help requests

- [ ] peer feedback from some seasoned Svelte 3 users
- [ ] Should we have a `.files` field in `package.json`?  What's it used for?
